On September 9th, 2020, the refugee camp *Moria* on the island Lesbos, Greece, burnt down. About 12,600 refugees lost their shelter `5`.

Especially since 2015 `4`, a lot of people are seeking asylum in Europe `3`, yet the economical Union utilizes its political power to create an inequality in the distribution of the responsibility. A continuously rising conflict, reinforcing right-wing parties, that eventually could mean the end of this social-economical experiment.

This map intends to display the distribution of refugees `9`, trying to extrapolate the current situation to 2025, as well as visualizing a distribution that meets the EU’s communicated values better by taking each country’s wealth `7` into account.
